*A Spellbook*

These books will cast any valid spell contained within, and have a shorter
cooldown (70% of the duration by default) than spoken spells. In addition,
tools such as Spellbooks won't generally negatively affect their user.

They can be crafted by placing a **[Spellbook Binder](spellbook-binder.md)** and
a Written Book in a Crafting Table.

**Prior to 1.20, Spellbooks are crafted in the Smithing Table.**

## Obfuscation
You can hide the contents of a Spellbook and prevent it from being crafted
back into a regular book by crafting it with a Glow Ink Sac.
