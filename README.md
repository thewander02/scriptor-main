Welcome to Scriptor, the mod which gives words power.
This Vanilla-style mod adds various kinds of magic spell to the world
with the aim of making discovery and spellcrafting simple, interesting,
and reasonable when compared to Vanilla gear and capabilities.

In this mod, spells are constructed much like sentences, with a catch:

**The words and sentence structure used are random in every world!**

For the average player, plenty of spells can be obtained in each world,
but for anyone dedicated enough, you can reverse engineer these spells
and learn how to draft even more powerful spells yourself.

For information on usage and such, check out the docs on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/ssblur/scriptor/blob/main/doc/README.md)
or explore the world in game to learn more about how magic works for
you.
